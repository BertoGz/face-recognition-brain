## Face Recognition Brain

This is the repo for the Front-end.
It was created using ReactJs and NativeBase.
I hope this project can demonstrate my understanding of
React, its patterns and fundamentals + hooks, state, project organization and skillset with javascript,
It has a login form where a user can register/sign-up
and a second route where the user can begin using the image recognition api.

## `Installation`

simply clone repo, cd to directory, run yarn. run yarn start
